<h3 class="text-center"> <i> GAURDIAN  FACULTY  MEMBER (GFM) : </i></h3>
     <ul style="list-style-type:circle;" id="js">
           <li> As a GFM, the faculty member has the responsibility for creating in his or her classroom or laboratory a climate that encourages 
                the Allocated students to learn. </li><br>
           <li>The faculty member should exemplify high scholarly standards and respect and foster the students right to choose and pursue his
                or her own educational goals.</li><br>
           <li>The GFM must make clear the objectives of the course or program, establish requirements, set standards of achievement, and 
                evaluate the students performance.</li><br>
           <li>The GFM has the responsibility to meet classes as scheduled and, when circumstances prevent this, to arrange equivalent alternate
                 instruction.</li><br>
           <li>The GFM has the responsibility to teach courses in a manner that is consistent with the course description and credit published in the
                catalogue and with the announced objectives of the course. He or she must not intentionally interject into classes material or personal views that have no
                pedagogicl relationship to the subject matter of the course.</li><br>
           <li>In order to facilitate student learning, faculty members should present the appropriate context for course content. While challenge is 
                essential to good teaching, challenge is ordinarily most effective when students are adequately prepared to deal with course materials. On controversial 
                issues within the scope of the course a reasonable range of opinion should be presented. When the faculty member presents his or her own views on such 
                issues, they should always be identified as such. Wherever values, judgments, or speculative opinions constitute part of the subject matter, they should be 
                identified as such and should not be offered as fact.</li><br>
           <li>The GFM owes to the student and the University a fair and impartial evaluation of the students work. Such evaluation should be 
                consistent with recognized standards and must not be influenced by irrelevancies such as religion, race, sex, or political views, or be based on the students 
                agreement with the teachers opinion pertaining to matters of controversy within the discipline.</li><br>
           <li> Every student is entitled to the same intellectual freedom which the faculty member enjoys. The GFM must respect that freedom. 
                Restraint must not be imposed upon the students search for or consideration of diverse or contrary opinion. More positively, the faculty member has an 
                obligation to protect the students freedom to learn, especially when that freedom is threatened by repressive or disruptive action. </li><br>
           <li> The classroom must remain a place where free and open discussion of all content and issues relevant to a course can take place. While 
                 students remain responsible for learning class material and completion of course requirements, faculty should respect reasonable decisions by students, 
                 based on their exercise of their own intellectual freedom, to not attend part or all of a particular class session. </li><br>
           <li> The GFM has obligations as an intellectual guide and counselor to students. He or she has a responsibility to be available to students 
                for private conferences. In advising students, every reasonable effort should be made to see that information given to them is accurate. The progress of 
                students in achieving their academic goals should not be thwarted or retarded unreasonably because a faculty member has neglected his or her obligation 
                as adviser and counselor. </li><br>
           <li> The GFM must avoid exploitation of students for personal advantage. For example, in writings and oral presentations due acknowledgment 
                of their contributions to the work should be made. </li><br>
